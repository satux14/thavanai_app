## 🔧 **Step 1: Install EAS CLI (If not already installed)**

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

**Login to your Expo account:**
```bash
eas login
```

If you don't have an Expo account:
```bash
eas register
```

---

## 🔑 **Step 2: Configure Your Project for EAS Build**

**Check your current configuration:**
```bash
cd /Users/skumarraju/Documents/Work/progs/thavanai_mobile
cat eas.json
```

Your `eas.json` is already configured for production builds!

**Verify app.json settings:**
```bash
cat app.json | grep -A 10 android
```

Should show:
- package: `com.thesrsconsulting.tapp`
- versionCode: 1

---

## 🏗️ **Step 3: Build Android App Bundle (AAB)**

### **Option A: Build in the Cloud (Recommended)**

This is the easiest method - Expo will build your app in the cloud.

```bash
cd /Users/skumarraju/Documents/Work/progs/thavanai_mobile

# Build for production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

**What happens:**
1. Uploads your code to Expo servers
2. Builds the Android App Bundle (.aab)
3. Provides download link when complete (15-20 minutes)

**During build, you'll be asked:**
- Generate a new Android Keystore? → **Yes** (first time)
- Keystore will be stored securely by Expo

**After build completes:**
- Download the `.aab` file from the provided link
- Save it to: `/Users/skumarraju/Documents/Work/progs/thavanai_mobile/builds/`

### **Option B: Build Locally**

```bash
# If you prefer local build
eas build --platform android --profile production --local
```

**Note:** Requires Android SDK installed on your Mac.

---

## 📱 **Step 4: Test Your Build (Optional but Recommended)**
