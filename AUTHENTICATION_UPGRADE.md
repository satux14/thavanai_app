# 🔐 Authentication & QR Code System Upgrade

## Major Features Being Added

### 1. **User Authentication System**
- ✅ Login/Register screens
- ✅ Secure password hashing (SHA-256)
- ✅ User sessions
- ✅ Logout functionality

### 2. **Book Ownership & Sharing**
- **Owner (Lender)**: Creates books when lending money
- **Debtor (Borrower)**: Receives shared books
- Each book has an owner and can be shared with debtors
- Two sections:
  - "My Books" - Books you own (as lender)
  - "Shared with Me" - Books others shared (as borrower)

### 3. **QR Code Payment Verification**
- **Owner generates QR code** daily for each entry
- **Debtor scans QR code** when paying
- QR code contains:
  - Date & Time
  - Credit Amount
  - Balance Amount
  - Owner's unique ID
  - Entry details
  - Location (optional)
  - Encrypted with secure key
- **Auto-expires** after 24 hours
- **Cannot be forged** - requires owner's login

### 4. **Daily Payment Flow**

```
Day 1:
  Owner: Opens entry → Clicks "Generate QR"
         → QR code generated with today's payment info
  
  Debtor: Gives money → Scans QR code
          → Entry automatically signed/verified
          → Both parties have proof
```
