# iOS Development & Testing Guide

## üçé Why iOS Stopped Working After AdMob

### The Issue:
After adding AdMob (a **native module**), the iOS app needs to be **rebuilt** because:
1. AdMob SDK needs to be installed via CocoaPods
2. Native code (Objective-C/Swift) needs to be compiled
3. The development build is no longer compatible

### Before AdMob:
- `npx expo start` ‚Üí Scan QR ‚Üí App worked ‚úÖ

### After AdMob:
- Native modules changed
- Old development build is outdated ‚ùå
- Need to rebuild native iOS app ‚úÖ

---

## üöÄ Solution: Rebuild iOS App

### Method 1: Build & Run on Simulator (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/skumarraju/Documents/Work/progs/thavanai_mobile

# This will:
# 1. Install CocoaPods dependencies
# 2. Build the iOS app with Xcode
# 3. Launch iOS simulator
# 4. Install and run the app
npx expo run:ios
```

**First time:** This will take 5-10 minutes (compiling native code)
**Subsequent runs:** 1-2 minutes (incremental build)

---

### Method 2: Build & Run on Physical Device

```bash
# Run on connected iPhone/iPad
npx expo run:ios --device
```

**Requirements:**
- Mac computer
- Xcode installed
- iPhone connected via USB
- Apple Developer account (free tier works)

---

### Method 3: Use EAS Build (Cloud Build)

```bash
# Build development client on EAS
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Install on your device, then:
npx expo start --dev-client
```

**Advantage:** No local Xcode needed
**Disadvantage:** Slower (cloud build takes time)

---

## üîß Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Command not found: xcodebuild"

**Problem:** Xcode not installed or not in PATH

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Xcode from App Store
# Then install command line tools:
sudo xcode-select --install

# Verify installation:
xcodebuild -version
```

---

### Issue 2: "No development build installed"

**Problem:** Old development build is incompatible

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete old app from simulator
# Then rebuild:
npx expo run:ios
```

**Or manually:**
1. Open Simulator
2. Long-press app icon ‚Üí Delete
3. Run `npx expo run:ios` again

---

### Issue 3: "CocoaPods could not find compatible versions"

**Problem:** Pod dependency conflicts

**Solution:**
```bash
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
npx expo run:ios
```

---

### Issue 4: Build fails with AdMob errors

**Problem:** AdMob configuration issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean everything and rebuild
cd ios
xcodebuild clean
rm -rf build
cd ..
npx expo run:ios
```

---

### Issue 5: "No simulators available"

**Problem:** No iOS simulators installed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Open Xcode
# Go to: Window ‚Üí Devices and Simulators
# Click '+' to add a simulator
# Choose iOS version and device type

# Or via command line:
xcrun simctl list devices
```

---

## üì± Development Workflow

### After Native Module Changes:

1. **First time after adding native modules:**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios  # Rebuild required
   ```

2. **JavaScript-only changes:**
   ```bash
   # App is already installed, just reload
   Press 'r' in terminal to reload
   ```

3. **Native code changes (rare):**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios  # Rebuild required
   ```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Build and run on simulator
npx expo run:ios

# Build and run on specific simulator
npx expo run:ios --simulator="iPhone 15 Pro"

# Build and run on connected device
npx expo run:ios --device

# List available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices

# Open iOS simulator
open -a Simulator

# Clean build
cd ios && xcodebuild clean && cd ..

# Reinstall pods
cd ios && rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock && pod install && cd ..
```

## üéØ Testing AdMob on iOS Simulator

### Important: Test Ads Only!

**iOS Simulator Limitations:**
- ‚úÖ Can show test ads
- ‚úÖ Can test ad placement and UI
- ‚ùå Cannot test real ads (policy violation)
- ‚ùå Cannot click ads (no revenue)

**Test Ad Unit IDs** (already configured):
```
Banner:       ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2934735716
Interstitial: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/4411468910
App Open:     ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5662855259
```

### Testing Steps:

1. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

2. **Check console for AdMob initialization:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ AdMob initialized successfully
   ‚úÖ Banner ad loaded
   ‚úÖ Interstitial ad loaded
   ‚úÖ App Open ad loaded
   ```

3. **Test each ad type:**
   - Banner: Go to Dashboard ‚Üí See banner at bottom
   - Interstitial: Create 5 books ‚Üí Full-screen ad
   - App Open: Close app ‚Üí Reopen ‚Üí Full-screen ad

4. **Verify test ads show:**
   - Green background with "Test Ad" label
   - If real ad unit IDs showing: Check `__DEV__` flag

## üçé iOS-Specific AdMob Notes

### App Tracking Transparency (ATT):

iOS requires permission to track users for ads. AdMob library handles this automatically, but you can customize:

**In Info.plist (already configured):**
```xml
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use tracking to show you relevant ads</string>
```

### SKAdNetwork:

For iOS 14.5+, Apple requires SKAdNetwork identifiers. These are already included via the AdMob SDK.

---

## üìä Development vs Production

### Development Mode (`__DEV__ = true`):
- Uses test ad unit IDs
- Shows test ads (green background)
- Safe for testing
- No AdMob policy violations

### Production Mode (TestFlight/App Store):
- Uses real ad unit IDs
- Shows real ads
- Generates revenue
- Must follow AdMob policies

---

## üîÑ Switching Between Platforms

### After working on iOS, switch to Android:
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

### After working on Android, switch to iOS:
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

### Web (no rebuild needed):
```bash
npx expo start --web
```

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Keep simulator running:** Faster rebuilds
2. **Use Xcode for debugging:** Better error messages
3. **Check iOS logs:** More detailed than terminal
4. **Clean build if issues:** Solves 90% of problems
5. **Update CocoaPods:** `sudo gem install cocoapods`

---

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

### Check Prerequisites:
```bash
# Node version (should be 18+)
node --version

# NPM version
npm --version

# Xcode version (should be 14+)
xcodebuild -version

# CocoaPods version
pod --version

# Expo CLI version
npx expo --version
```

### Common Prerequisites Issues:

**Node too old:**
```bash
# Update Node.js
brew upgrade node
```

**Xcode too old:**
```bash
# Update Xcode from App Store
# Then update command line tools:
sudo xcode-select --install
```

**CocoaPods too old:**
```bash
# Update CocoaPods
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

iOS development is working when:
1. ‚úÖ `npx expo run:ios` builds successfully
2. ‚úÖ Simulator launches automatically
3. ‚úÖ App installs and opens
4. ‚úÖ AdMob logs appear in console
5. ‚úÖ Test ads show in the app
6. ‚úÖ Hot reload works (press 'r' to reload)

---

## üéì Summary

### Before AdMob (Managed Workflow):
```bash
npx expo start  # Just works ‚úÖ
```

### After AdMob (Bare Workflow with Native Modules):
```bash
# iOS: Need to build native code
npx expo run:ios

# Android: Need to build native code  
npx expo run:android

# Web: No build needed
npx expo start --web
```

**Key Takeaway:** Native modules = native builds required

---

**Current Status:** `npx expo run:ios` is running in the background.
This will take 5-10 minutes for the first build. ‚è±Ô∏è

**Next:** Once build completes, simulator will open automatically! üéâ
