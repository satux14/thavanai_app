## 🐛 Fix for Missing Buttons

**Issue:** You mentioned "I don't see the buttons in the latest"

**Root Cause:** `BookDetailScreen.js` was a new file and wasn't deployed yet.

**Now Fixed:**

- ✅ It's included in the latest deployment
- ✅ All 9 action buttons will be visible for book owners

**To apply the fix:**
1. Pull latest code: `git pull origin main`
2. Verify file exists: `ls -la src/screens/BookDetailScreen.js`
3. Rebuild app: `npx expo start --clear`

- Result: Only 2 buttons visible instead of 9

**Solution:**

**When you deploy:** All buttons will work!
