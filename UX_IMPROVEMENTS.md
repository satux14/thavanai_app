# UX Improvements Implementation

## Summary
Implemented three key user experience improvements to streamline the workflow and reduce manual data entry.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enter Key to Login/Register (Keyboard Submission)

**Login Screen** (`LoginScreen.js`):
- Added `returnKeyType="next"` to username field
- Added `returnKeyType="go"` and `onSubmitEditing={handleLogin}` to password field
- Users can now press Enter after typing password to submit the login form

**Register Screen** (`RegisterScreen.js`):
- Added `returnKeyType="next"` to all fields except the last
- Added `returnKeyType="go"` and `onSubmitEditing={handleRegister}` to confirm password field
- Users can now press Enter after typing confirm password to submit the registration form

### 2. Auto-Fill End Date (100 Days Calculation)

**Book Info Screen** (`BookInfoScreen.js`):
- Created `handleStartDateChange()` function that automatically calculates end date
- When user selects a start date, the end date is automatically set to 100 days later
- Formula: `End Date = Start Date + 100 days`
- Only applies when creating a new book (not when editing existing books)
- End date can still be manually adjusted if needed

**Example**:
- Start Date: 2025-01-01
- End Date (auto-filled): 2025-04-11

### 3. Auto-Fill 100 Days of Entries

**Entries Screen** (`EntriesScreen.js`):
- Created `autoFill100DaysEntries()` function
- Automatically creates 100 entries with pre-filled dates when a new book is opened for the first time
- Dates are calculated sequentially from the book's start date
- Creates 10 pages (10 entries per page Ã— 10 pages = 100 entries)
- Only the date field is pre-filled; amount, balance, and signature remain empty for manual entry
- Users can immediately start filling in payment amounts without manually entering dates

**Entry Generation Logic**:
```
Entry 1: Start Date + 0 days
Entry 2: Start Date + 1 day
Entry 3: Start Date + 2 days
...
Entry 100: Start Date + 99 days
```

**Example**:
If a book has a start date of January 1, 2025:
- Page 1 (Entries 1-10): Jan 1-10, 2025
- Page 2 (Entries 11-20): Jan 11-20, 2025
- ...
- Page 10 (Entries 91-100): Mar 31 - Apr 9, 2025

## Benefits

1. **Faster Login**: No need to reach for the mouse/tap the button - just press Enter
2. **Less Manual Calculation**: End date is automatically computed based on standard 100-day loan period
3. **Reduced Data Entry**: 100 dates are pre-filled, saving significant time
4. **Better UX Flow**: Users can focus on entering payment amounts rather than dates
5. **Consistency**: All dates follow a sequential pattern from the start date

## Technical Details

- All date calculations use JavaScript `Date` object
- Dates are stored in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- AsyncStorage is used to persist the maximum page number
- Auto-fill only triggers for new books (when `entries.length === 0`)
- Error handling ensures the app continues even if auto-fill fails

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login Flow**: Type username, press Enter, type password, press Enter
2. **Book Creation**: Select start date and verify end date auto-fills to +100 days
3. **First Book Entry**: After creating a book, verify 100 entries with sequential dates appear
4. **Edit Existing Book**: Verify changing start date doesn't override manually set end date
5. **Page Navigation**: Verify all 10 pages are created and navigable
